# Investigation Report: OEM Service Down - PaymentController

## Initial Assessment: NO LOGS FOUND

## What the Logs Show:
The query for thread ID "152492" with error-related terms in the Payment Controller service returned no results. Despite searching for logs containing the specific thread ID associated with client ID 2796506, no matching log entries were found that would explain the "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED" errors recorded in the client data.

## Investigation Summary:

Based on the available information:

1. **Missing Log Data**: There appears to be a gap in the logging for the Payment Controller service. Despite having client records showing multiple product validation failures for client ID 2796506, we cannot find corresponding error logs in the Payment Controller service for the associated thread ID.

2. **Client Impact**: The client data shows that client ID 2796506 experienced repeated product validation failures between 15:08:44 and 15:13:28 on 2025-11-10, with at least 8 consecutive failures recorded.

3. **Potential Causes**:
   - The logs may be stored in a different service or location not included in this query
   - Log retention issues may have occurred
   - The error might be happening in a different component that interacts with the Payment Controller
   - The thread ID "152492" might not be properly logged in error scenarios

4. **Next Steps for Investigation**:
   - Expand the search to other related services, particularly any product validation services
   - Check for network connectivity issues between PaymentController and the OEM service
   - Examine system health metrics for the time period in question
   - Review logs without thread ID filtering to identify any system-wide issues during this timeframe

Without relevant log entries, we cannot definitively determine the root cause of the OEM service outage affecting the PaymentController. Additional log sources or broader queries are needed to properly diagnose this critical issue.
