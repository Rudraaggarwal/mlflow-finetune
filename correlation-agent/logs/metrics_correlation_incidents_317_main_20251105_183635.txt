# Memory Usage Anomaly Analysis Report

## Primary Issue
**No Actual Memory Anomaly Detected**

Despite the critical alert for a "Memory Usage Anomaly" in the oemconnector service, the performance data shows **stable memory usage** throughout the monitoring period:

- **Memory Usage**: Consistently at 305.2 MB (305,217,536 bytes)
- **Memory RSS**: Consistently at 294.7 MB (294,739,968 bytes)
- **Memory Request**: 536.9 MB (536,870,912 bytes)
- **Memory Utilization**: ~56.8% of requested memory (305.2 MB used of 536.9 MB requested)

The data shows no memory spikes, leaks, or unusual patterns during the alert period (06:21:32Z to 06:23:32Z on 2025-11-05).

## Related Performance Issues

**1. CPU Usage Remained Minimal**
- CPU utilization was extremely low, averaging only 0.1% (0.001 CPU cores)
- CPU usage remained stable with minimal variation (between 0.00102 and 0.00113 cores)
- No correlation between CPU and the reported memory anomaly

**2. Missing JVM Metrics**
- JVM-specific metrics (heap usage, garbage collection) returned no data
- This suggests either:
  - The application is not exposing JVM metrics to Prometheus
  - The metrics may be exposed under different labels than queried
  - The service might not be a JVM-based application

## System Impact

**1. No Observable Service Degradation**
- The previous investigation found normal application activity with consistent 30-second filter processing
- No memory-related errors or exceptions were logged
- The service continued to process requests normally

**2. No HTTP Request Rate Impact**
- The query for HTTP request rates returned no data
- This aligns with the previous investigation finding that the service continued normal operations

**3. Resource Utilization Context**
- Memory usage (305.2 MB) was well below the requested amount (536.9 MB)
- No memory limit was explicitly set (container_spec_memory_limit_bytes query returned empty)
- The container was not under resource pressure during the alert period

## Performance Timeline

The performance metrics show remarkable stability throughout the monitoring window:

- **06:21:30Z to 06:23:30Z**: Memory usage remained constant at 305.2 MB
- **No Fluctuations**: Unlike typical memory anomalies, there were no spikes, drops, or gradual increases
- **CPU Pattern**: CPU usage showed minimal variation (±0.0001 cores) with a slight increase to 0.00113 cores at the end of the monitoring period

## Conclusion

**False Positive Alert**

The data strongly suggests this was a false positive alert:

1. **No Memory Anomaly Evidence**: Memory usage was stable at 305.2 MB throughout the monitoring period
2. **Healthy Resource Utilization**: The service was using only 56.8% of its requested memory
3. **Normal Operations**: Previous log analysis confirmed the service was functioning normally

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Review Alert Configuration**: Check the memory anomaly detection thresholds and algorithms
2. **Investigate Monitoring System**: Determine if there was a temporary issue with the monitoring infrastructure
3. **Enhance JVM Metrics**: Configure proper JVM metrics collection if this is a Java application
4. **Correlate with Infrastructure Events**: Check if any infrastructure changes occurred around 06:22:32Z

This appears to be a monitoring system issue rather than an actual application performance problem, as all available metrics indicate normal and stable operation of the oemconnector service.
