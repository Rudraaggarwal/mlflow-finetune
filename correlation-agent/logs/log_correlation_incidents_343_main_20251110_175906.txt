# Investigation Report: OEM Service Down - PaymentController

## Initial Assessment: NO LOGS FOUND

## What the Logs Show

After conducting a comprehensive search through the PaymentController logs using multiple query patterns, I found no log entries matching any of the search criteria. The searches included:

- Error and exception messages
- Warning messages
- Transaction and payment processing activities
- Connection issues (timeouts, refused connections)
- Service status and health checks
- Database operations

The complete absence of logs is significant and concerning, as we would expect to see at least some operational logs from a functioning service.

## Investigation Summary

### Key Finding: Complete Absence of Logs

The PaymentController service appears to be completely non-operational. The absence of any logs, including basic operational logs, strongly suggests that the service is not running at all rather than experiencing a partial failure or degraded performance.

### Likely Causes

Based on the complete absence of logs, the most probable causes are:

1. **Complete Service Failure**: The PaymentController service may have crashed entirely or failed to start.
2. **Logging System Disconnection**: The service might be running but completely disconnected from the logging infrastructure.
3. **Deployment Issue**: A recent deployment may have failed, preventing the service from starting.
4. **Infrastructure Problem**: The underlying infrastructure (VM, container, or pod) hosting the service may be down.

### System Impact

This outage would have significant business impacts:

- Payment processing would be completely unavailable
- Customer transactions would fail
- Revenue would be directly affected
- Customer experience would be severely degraded

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Service Restart**: Attempt an immediate restart of the PaymentController service
2. **Infrastructure Check**: Verify the status of the hosting infrastructure (VM/container health)
3. **Deployment Review**: Check if there was a recent deployment that might have caused the issue
4. **Log Pipeline Verification**: Confirm the logging pipeline is functioning correctly
5. **Dependency Check**: Verify if critical dependencies required by PaymentController are available

This appears to be a complete service outage rather than a partial failure, requiring immediate attention from the operations team.
