# Investigation Report: OEM Service Down - PaymentController Issue

## Initial Assessment: NO LOGS FOUND

## What the Logs Show

After reviewing the provided application logs for the PaymentController service, I found that no logs were returned from the query. The log query `{job="PaymentController"}` produced empty results `[]`, indicating either:

1. The PaymentController service was completely down and not generating any logs
2. There is a logging configuration issue preventing logs from being captured
3. The logs may be stored in a different location or under a different job name than what was queried

## Investigation Summary

### Key Findings

- **Complete Absence of Logs**: The PaymentController service shows no log entries at all around the critical incident time (2025-11-10 15:11:37.447).

- **Multiple Failed Transactions**: Database analysis identified 8 failed transactions (IDs 116377-116382, 116385-116386) all from the same client (2796506) with the error message "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED".

- **Service Outage Pattern**: The clustering of failed transactions from the same client within a short timeframe suggests a complete service outage rather than isolated transaction failures.

### Impact Assessment

- **Client Impact**: At minimum, client 2796506 experienced multiple failed payment transactions.
- **Business Impact**: The PaymentController is a critical service for processing payments, so this outage likely prevented all payment processing during the incident window.
- **Error Type**: The "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED" error suggests the PaymentController was unable to validate products before processing payments.

### Possible Root Causes

Without logs from the PaymentController service, I can only suggest potential causes:

1. **Complete Service Crash**: The PaymentController service may have crashed entirely, explaining the absence of logs.
2. **Dependency Failure**: The service that validates products (likely an OEM service based on the alert title) appears to be unavailable.
3. **Network Connectivity**: There could be network connectivity issues between the PaymentController and the product validation service.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Expand Log Search**: Query logs from related services, particularly any OEM service responsible for product validation.
2. **Check Infrastructure**: Investigate server/container health metrics for the PaymentController service.
3. **Verify Logging Configuration**: Ensure the PaymentController service is correctly configured to send logs to the centralized logging system.
4. **Review Dependency Health**: Check the status of all services that PaymentController depends on, especially the product validation service.

This incident requires further investigation as the current logs do not provide sufficient information to determine the exact root cause of the PaymentController service outage.
