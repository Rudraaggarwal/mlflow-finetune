# OEM Service Down Investigation Report

## Initial Assessment: RELEVANT

## What the Logs Show:

### CRITICAL FINDING: Internal Server Error Detected
The logs reveal an Internal Server Error occurred in the PaymentController service at 15:09:48,653 on November 10, 2025:
```
[CProductValidation::ProductValidate][INFORMATION] ResponseMsg: Internal Server Error occurred.
```

This Internal Server Error directly led to the "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED" error message that was reported in the client data.

### Transaction Timeline for Thread ID 152344:
1. **15:09:48,465**: The system attempted to validate a product with IMEI "heheeueuwuwqqi"
2. **15:09:48,543**: No data found for this IMEI in the product status tables
3. **15:09:48,653**: Internal Server Error occurred during product validation
4. **15:09:48,653**: System generated "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED" response
5. **15:09:48,684-15:09:48,699**: Error logging procedures executed
6. **15:09:50,647**: Client thread exited with error code 220 and message "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED"

### Error Pattern:
The logs show a consistent pattern where the PaymentController service:
1. Attempts to validate a product
2. Encounters an Internal Server Error
3. Aborts the transaction
4. Logs the failure to the error tables
5. Returns "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED" to the client

## Investigation Summary:

The OEM Service Down issue is directly related to an Internal Server Error occurring during product validation in the PaymentController service. This matches the client data showing repeated "PRODUCT VALIDATION CALL FAILED" errors for client ID 2796506.

The root cause appears to be the PaymentController's inability to validate products due to an internal server error. The logs specifically show thread ID 152344 (which matches one of our identified thread IDs from the client data) encountering this error at 15:09:48.

The system is correctly logging these failures and attempting to handle them gracefully, but the underlying service issue persists. The client experienced at least 7 consecutive failures between 15:08 and 15:13, indicating this was not an isolated incident but a sustained service outage.

The invalid IMEI format ("heheeueuwuwqqi") in the logs suggests there might be an issue with the data being sent for validation or how it's being processed. This could be either a client-side data issue or a server-side parsing problem.

Based on the evidence, the PaymentController's product validation service is experiencing a critical failure that is preventing normal transaction processing, resulting in the OEM Service Down alert.
