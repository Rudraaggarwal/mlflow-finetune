# Investigation Report: EMI Paylater Catalogue Service Down

## Initial Assessment: NO LOGS FOUND

## What the Logs Show

After querying the logs for the paylater service across multiple search patterns (errors, info messages, catalogue-related entries, and startup/health status), no log entries were returned. This complete absence of logs is significant and indicates one of several possible scenarios:

1. The paylater service containers may not be running at all
2. The logging system may not be capturing output from the paylater service
3. The service may be deployed in a different namespace than expected

The lack of even basic informational or startup logs suggests this is not just an application error but potentially a more fundamental deployment or infrastructure issue.

## Investigation Summary

### Why This Matters

The complete absence of logs is actually an important finding. Normally, even when a service is experiencing problems, we would expect to see some log entries - either error messages or at least startup information. The fact that we see nothing suggests the service may not be running at all.

### Likely Cause

Based on the evidence, the most probable causes are:

1. **Deployment Failure**: The paylater service pods may have failed to deploy or start properly
2. **Infrastructure Issue**: There could be a node or cluster-level problem preventing the service from running
3. **Configuration Error**: The service might be misconfigured, causing it to fail before it can even generate logs
4. **Logging Pipeline Issue**: While less likely, there could be a problem with the log collection system itself

### System Impact

The EMI Paylater Catalogue Service being down would affect:

- Users attempting to view or access EMI payment options
- Any checkout flows that depend on EMI payment methods
- Other services that integrate with the paylater catalogue for product financing options

## Recommended Next Steps

Since logs alone don't provide sufficient information, I recommend:

1. Check Kubernetes pod status for the paylater service to confirm if pods are running
2. Verify recent deployments or configuration changes to the service
3. Check infrastructure metrics for the nodes where this service typically runs
4. Examine any recent changes to service dependencies that might affect its operation
5. Review monitoring dashboards for additional context about when the service stopped functioning

This appears to be an infrastructure or deployment issue rather than an application-level error, as we would expect to see at least some logs if the application had started and then encountered problems.
