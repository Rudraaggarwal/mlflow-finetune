# Memory Usage Anomaly Investigation Report

## Initial Assessment: NOT RELEVANT

After reviewing the provided logs for the oemconnector service, I found no direct evidence of memory usage anomalies that would explain the critical alert. The logs do not contain any memory-related errors, heap issues, garbage collection problems, or out-of-memory exceptions.

## What the Logs Show

### Error Patterns
The logs show normal application activity with some client errors, but nothing indicating memory problems:

1. **Client Error (2025-11-05T06:20:30.838Z)**
   - A validation error occurred when processing a request from LENOVO
   - Error type: `INVALID_REQUEST` with message "Request is not well-formed, syntactically incorrect, or violates schema"
   - Specific issue: Missing required parameter `merchant.state_code`
   - This is a normal application-level error, not a system resource issue

2. **Regular Application Activity**
   - The logs show consistent filter processing every 30 seconds from 06:20:32Z through 06:27:02Z
   - Example: `"Body":"Inside ResponseHeaderFilter.doFilter()"` entries appear regularly
   - These entries indicate normal request processing patterns

3. **No Memory-Related Logs**
   - The specific query for memory-related terms (`memory`, `heap`, `gc`, `out of memory`, `oom`) returned no results
   - No stack traces or exceptions related to memory management were found

## Investigation Summary

### Why This Matters
The absence of memory-related logs is significant because:

1. **False Positive Alert**: The "Memory Usage Anomaly" alert appears to be unrelated to any actual memory issues in the application logs. The service is processing requests normally without memory errors.

2. **Normal Error Handling**: The application is correctly handling validation errors (like the missing `merchant.state_code` parameter) without any indication of memory pressure or resource constraints.

3. **Consistent Processing Pattern**: The regular 30-second intervals in filter processing suggest the application is operating in a stable, predictable manner throughout the time period surrounding the alert.

### Likely Cause
Based on the evidence, I can conclude:

1. The memory usage anomaly alert is likely **not related to application behavior** captured in these logs.

2. Possible alternative explanations:
   - The alert might be triggered by infrastructure-level metrics not visible in application logs
   - There could be a monitoring system configuration issue causing false positives
   - The memory spike might have been temporary and resolved before causing application errors

### System Impact
Despite the alert, the application appears to be functioning normally:

1. The service continued to process requests without interruption
2. No user-impacting errors beyond normal validation issues were observed
3. The application maintained its regular processing pattern throughout the alert period

## Conclusion

The logs do not provide evidence supporting a memory usage anomaly in the oemconnector service. I recommend:

1. Checking infrastructure-level metrics (container stats, host metrics) for the time period
2. Reviewing alert thresholds and configurations for potential false positives
3. Correlating with other monitoring systems to identify any actual resource constraints

The application itself appears to be functioning normally with appropriate error handling for invalid requests.
