# Investigation Report: EMI Paylater Catalogue Service Down

## Initial Assessment: NO LOGS FOUND

## What the Logs Show

After searching through multiple log queries targeting the catalogueserv container and paylater namespace, no logs were found for any of the following:

- Error, failure, exception, warning, or fatal messages in catalogueserv
- Informational, startup, or initialization messages in catalogueserv
- Restart, crash, OOM (Out of Memory), or killed process messages in catalogueserv
- Any catalogue-related messages in the paylater container
- Any deployment, replica, scaling, or availability issues in the paylater namespace

The complete absence of logs across all queries is unusual and suggests one of several possibilities:

1. The catalogueserv container may not be running at all
2. The logging system itself may be experiencing issues
3. The service may be deployed but not generating any logs

## Investigation Summary

The complete absence of logs for the catalogueserv is highly significant. When a service is operational, even in a degraded state, we would typically expect to see some logs - either error messages or normal operational logs.

### Likely Causes

Based on the evidence (or lack thereof), the most probable causes are:

1. **Complete Service Outage**: The catalogueserv may not be deployed or running at all in the paylater namespace. This would explain why we see no logs of any kind.

2. **Deployment Issue**: The service might have failed to deploy properly, or all pods might be in a failed/crashed state with no logging capability.

3. **Log Collection Problem**: There could be an issue with the log collection system itself, preventing logs from being captured or indexed properly.

### System Impact

The EMI Paylater Catalogue Service appears to be completely down, which would impact:

- Product catalog availability for the paylater service
- Any dependent services that rely on product information
- Customer ability to browse available products for EMI payment options

### Next Steps for Investigation

Since logs don't provide any insights, I recommend:

1. Checking the deployment status of catalogueserv using Kubernetes commands:
   ```
   kubectl get deployments -n paylater
   kubectl describe deployment catalogueserv -n paylater
   ```

2. Verifying if pods exist and their status:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n paylater | grep catalogueserv
   ```

3. Checking for recent changes or deployments that might have affected the service

4. Investigating infrastructure-level issues that might prevent the service from starting

The complete absence of logs suggests this is likely a deployment or infrastructure issue rather than an application code problem.
