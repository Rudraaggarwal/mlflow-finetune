# EMI Paylater Catalogue Service Investigation Report

## Initial Assessment: NO LOGS FOUND

## What the Logs Show

After querying the logging system for the Paylater Catalogue Service issue reported on November 6, 2025, no relevant logs were found in any of the search phases. The investigation included:

- Searches for error, failure, and exception messages in the catalogueserv container
- Checks for informational and warning logs in the catalogueserv container
- Queries for startup, initialization, and health status messages in catalogueserv
- Error searches in the paylater container
- Specific searches for catalogue-related entries in the paylater container
- Connection and service-related information logs in the paylater container

All queries returned empty results, indicating either:
1. The logs for the affected time period are not available in the queried system
2. The service containers may not be running or generating logs
3. The issue might be occurring in a different component not covered by these queries

## Investigation Summary

The complete absence of logs is itself significant information. When a service is reported as "down" but produces no error logs, this typically indicates one of several scenarios:

1. **Complete service failure**: The service may have crashed entirely or failed to start, preventing it from generating any logs
2. **Infrastructure issue**: The problem might be at the infrastructure level (network, Kubernetes, etc.) rather than within the application itself
3. **Log collection problem**: The logs might be generated but not properly collected or indexed
4. **Misconfigured monitoring**: The alert might be triggered by external monitoring that detected the service was unreachable, while the actual service might be running in a different namespace or location

## Impact and Recommendations

**Business Impact:**
- The EMI Paylater Catalogue Service being down likely affects customers' ability to view available EMI options for products
- This could directly impact sales conversion for higher-priced items where EMI is a key purchasing factor

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Verify the deployment status of the catalogueserv pods in the paylater namespace
2. Check Kubernetes events for the paylater namespace to identify pod scheduling or startup issues
3. Examine infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network) around the time of the incident
4. Review recent deployments or configuration changes to the service
5. Expand the log search to include other related services that might interact with the catalogue service
6. Check external dependencies like databases or third-party services that the catalogue service might rely on

Without logs to analyze, a more hands-on investigation involving direct pod inspection, infrastructure review, and deployment verification is necessary to determine the root cause.
